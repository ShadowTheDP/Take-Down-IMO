= Preliminaries

This PDF give all solution of the book _Modern Olympiad Number Theory V2_ written by *Aditya Khurmi*.

== The description of mathenv

Take an example:

#definition( 
  desp: "something" 
)[ 
  the main body 
] 

$stretch(=)^"    type name   "|stretch(=)^" num "|stretch(=)^"source in the book"|stretch(=)^"    the main body    "$ 

At the very first of this example, is the type name of this example, followed by the serial number of the example, the string inside the brackets is usually the source in the book _MONT_, the string after the "." is the main body of this mathenv.

== Notation

Common notations used in Number Theory:

- $ZZ$: The set of integers.
- $NN$: The set of natural numbers (positive integers).
- $a | b$: $a$ divides $b$.
- $gcd(a, b)$: The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.
- $lcm[a, b]$: The least common multiple of $a$ and $b$.
- $n!$: Factorial of $n$.
- $phi(n)$: Euler's totient function.
- $tau(n)$: Number of divisors of $n$.
- $sigma(n)$: Sum of divisors of $n$.
