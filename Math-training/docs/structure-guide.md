# Typst Project Structure Guide

## Purpose

This document explains how `Math-training/` is supposed to work as the main
Typst authoring workspace inside `Take-Down-IMO`.

Use this guide when you need the bigger architectural picture beyond the
repository root README.

Repo-wide rules still live in `../../README.md`. This guide is supplemental
structure documentation, not another project root README.

## Current Workspace Layout

The current relevant structure is:

```text
Code-Project/
  Project/
    Take-Down-IMO/
      README.md
      Math-training/
        entries/
          Note-to-EGMO.typ
          Note-to-MONT.typ
        docs/
          structure-guide.md
        assets/
          fonts/
        utils/
        output/
      typst-skills/
        README.md
  Project-source/
    Math/
```

Within `Math-training/`, the practical roles are:

- `entries/Note-to-EGMO.typ`
  - Style and structure reference implementation.
- `entries/Note-to-MONT.typ`
  - Active working document derived from source material.
- `docs/structure-guide.md`
  - Structure and workflow guide for the authoring workspace.
- `assets/fonts/`
  - Local font assets when the current style depends on them.
- `utils/`
  - Shared Typst modules. Changes here affect multiple documents.
- `output/`
  - Local generated files only. Do not commit build output.

## Authoring Model

This workspace follows a simple model:

1. Source material lives outside the repository in `Project-source/Math/` or
   in your own prepared Markdown notes.
2. You manually author or refine a Typst entry file in `entries/`.
3. Shared layout, math environments, and helper logic live in `utils/`.
4. PDFs and build notes go to `output/`.

`Math-training/` is not a dump of final PDFs. It is the editable source
workspace.

## Document Structure Expectations

For book-style answer sets, prefer this pattern:

- A preliminaries section at the beginning
  - Title page, short description, notation, and table of contents as needed.
- Main problem chapters in the middle
  - Focus on problems, exercises, or questions that the document is meant to
    solve.
- A collected results or appendix section at the end when needed
  - Theorems, lemmas, propositions, definitions, remarks, or other supporting
    entries that are useful for reference.

The exact chapter count can vary by book. What matters is preserving a clean
division between:

- main solve-oriented content
- supporting theory/reference content

## Style Expectations

When editing or creating a new document:

- Reuse the style decisions already demonstrated in `entries/Note-to-EGMO.typ`.
- Keep naming consistent with the existing `Note-to-BOOK.typ` pattern.
- Prefer extending top-level content files before changing `utils/`.
- Only change shared utilities when the change is intentionally global.
- Compile with Typst 0.14.0 or newer.

## Working Rules for AI Agents

If you are an AI agent working here:

1. Read `../README.md` first, then this guide.
2. Treat `entries/Note-to-EGMO.typ` as the style baseline.
3. Treat `utils/` as shared infrastructure, not a scratchpad.
4. Put generated files in `output/`.
5. Do not assume `output/` or local font files are tracked in Git.
6. Use the local `typst-skills/` directory from the parent repo for reference
   instead of guessing Typst syntax.

## Suggested Workflow

When converting a source book into Typst:

1. Start from the source PDF in `../../Project-source/Math/` or from your own
   prepared Markdown notes.
2. Identify the content that belongs in the main solve-oriented chapters.
3. Identify the supporting material that should become a collected results or
   appendix section.
4. Draft the content in a new or existing file under `entries/`.
5. Reuse `utils/` helpers and the `entries/Note-to-EGMO.typ` structure.
6. Compile into `output/`.
7. Review the rendered PDF before treating the work as done.

## Prompt Template for AI-Assisted Work

Use a prompt shaped like this when asking an AI agent to help:

```text
Work inside Project/Take-Down-IMO/Math-training.

Input:
- Source material from Project-source/Math/... or your own prepared Markdown
  notes.

Goal:
- Update or create an entry file under `entries/`.
- Follow the document style used by `entries/Note-to-EGMO.typ`.
- Keep shared utilities in utils/ stable unless a global change is necessary.
- Put generated files in output/.

Rules:
- Focus the main chapters on problem-solving content.
- Move supporting theorem/lemma/definition-style material into an appendix or
  collected results section when that structure fits the source.
- Preserve clean Typst formatting and working cross-references.
- Do not commit generated output unless a human explicitly asks for it.
```

## Notes

- Older prompts may still mention previous workspace names or absolute paths.
  Prefer the current `Project/Take-Down-IMO/Math-training` layout.
- If a guide, prompt, or README disagrees with the current repository
  structure, update the documentation before continuing large changes.
